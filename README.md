# Raindrop Animation using ncurses
Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QygMBlV_USk) by [Daniel Hirsch](https://www.youtube.com/@HirschDaniel) on youtube.

This project is just a simple implementation of a raindrop animation using the ncurses library in C. The animation simulates raindrops falling from the top of the terminal to the bottom, creating a visually appealing effect.

## Build and Run
Build the project using the following command:
```bash
gcc raindrop.c -o raindrop -lncurses && ./raindrop
```
- Ensure you have ncurses library installed on your system to compile and run the code successfully.
